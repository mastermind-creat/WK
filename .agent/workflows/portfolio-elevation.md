# Portfolio Elevation Workflow

## Phase 1: Codebase Sanitation ✓
- [x] Remove empty directories (assets/images, hooks, layouts)
- [x] Clean Font Awesome dependency (using Lucide React)
- [x] Remove inline styles from index.html
- [x] Audit all components for unused imports
- [x] Verify single responsibility per component

## Phase 2: Design System Overhaul
- [ ] Implement hierarchical typography scale
- [ ] Define premium color palette
- [ ] Create depth system (shadows, blur, elevation)
- [ ] Optimize mobile typography (aggressive reduction)
- [ ] Ensure perfect contrast in both themes

## Phase 3: Advanced Motion Layer
- [ ] Page transitions with Framer Motion
- [ ] Scroll-based animations (fade, translate, scale)
- [ ] Parallax effects (hero, floating elements)
- [ ] 3D depth illusions (preserve-3d, perspective)
- [ ] Respect reduced-motion preferences

## Phase 4: Section-Specific Refinements
- [ ] Hero: Cinematic entrance, parallax background
- [ ] Services: 3D hover tilt, glow animations
- [ ] HowIWork: Animated step transitions
- [ ] Projects: Interactive cards, hover reveals
- [ ] Contact/Chatbot: Polished floating CTA

## Phase 5: Responsive Philosophy
- [ ] Mobile-first custom designs per breakpoint
- [ ] Intelligent content reflow
- [ ] Reduced fonts/padding on mobile
- [ ] Increased white space and readability

## Phase 6: Performance & Polish
- [ ] Lazy-load heavy sections
- [ ] 60fps animation optimization
- [ ] Prevent layout shifts
- [ ] Fast initial paint
- [ ] Smooth scroll behavior
